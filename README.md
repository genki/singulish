Singulish: Singular English
====

The Simplified English that have no plural.

Some natural languages such as Japanese has no plurals go with no problem,
so that is redundant for simplified English.

Using language has no plural, it means you can think abstract concepts without image.
Suppose the scene some birds are flying but you don't know the count of the birds. The count can be one ore more. English can't describe the situation.
But Singulish can say just "Bird are flying".
Simplification is not a lack of expression but expansion.
